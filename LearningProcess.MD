Learning Process
Notes to refer back to for my learning. 

I initialy began creating the rock paper scissors game by creating all of my variables to do with games play and set them to zero, I then added them all into a large function full of else if statements and attempted to alert the result. This would give a result but only in the console when I called the function and result variable. 

Due to this i restarted the game and used less variables and worked through the tasks I kept getting stuck on alerting the result of the game.

I worked through a tutorial to learn the best way to create this game and learnt about the use of the 
$ symbol to get element by id $("id_of_element") and the || for the use of or . 
I also learnt about the use of "Data-type" for customised data and reinforced the flex knowledge I had learnt previously. 
syntax <element data-*="somevalue"> 
Span ID to mark part of a text, easily styled with CSS similar to<div> but used inline opposed to block.
